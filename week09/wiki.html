                    <p>The Arctic Monkeys were formed in 2002 by friends Alex Turner, Matt Helders, and Andy Nicholson. Turner and Helders were neighbours and close friends, and they met Nicholson in secondary school.[7] Turner, who had grown up in a musical household as his father was a music teacher, played guitar in the then-instrumental only band, with Helders on drums, Nicholson on bass, and a new band member, Jamie Cook as a second guitarist.[8] As time passed, Turner became the lead singer and frontman of the band as he had "a thing for words", according to Helders.[9] The band began rehearsing at Yellow Arch Studios in Neepsend[10] and played its first gig on 13 June 2003 at The Grapes in Sheffield city centre.[11] After a few performances in 2003, the band began to record demos at 2fly studios[12] in Sheffield. 18 songs were demoed in all and the collection, now known as Beneath the Boardwalk, was burned onto CDs to give away at gigs, which were promptly file-shared amongst fans. The name Beneath the Boardwalk originated when the first batch of demos were sent around. The first sender, wanting to classify the demos, named them after where he received them, the Boardwalk. Slowly, as more demos were spread, they were all classified under this name. This has led to many people falsely believing that Beneath the Boardwalk was an early album, or that the early demos were all released under this title. The group did not mind the distribution, saying "we never made those demos to make money or anything. We were giving them away free anyway – that was a better way for people to hear them."[13]</p>
                    <p>The band began to grow in popularity across the north of England,[14] receiving attention from BBC Radio and the British tabloid press. A local amateur photographer, Mark Bull, filmed the band's performances and made the music video "Fake Tales of San Francisco", releasing it on his website,[13] alongside the contents of Beneath the Boardwalk – a collection of the band's songs which he named after a local music venue. When asked about the popularity of the band's MySpace site, the band said that they were unaware of what it was, and that the site had originally been created by their fans.[13] In May 2005, Arctic Monkeys released the EP Five Minutes with Arctic Monkeys on their own 'Bang Bang' label, featuring the songs "Fake Tales of San Francisco" and "From the Ritz to the Rubble". This release was limited to 500 CDs and 1,000 7" records, but was also available to download from the iTunes Music Store. Soon after, the band played at the Carling Stage of the Reading and Leeds Festivals, reserved for less known or unsigned bands. Their appearance was hyped by much of the music press and the band was watched by an unusually large crowd.</p>
